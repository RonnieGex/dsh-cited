# Branch and environment baseline

Date: 2026-10-09. Agent: Codex /root. Branch: docs/brand-logos. Base SHA: 262f2132e79742c9d1e123dd41e1296755644ab8.

Executed from the parent workspace: git -C dsh-cited fetch origin; git -C dsh-cited switch -c docs/brand-logos origin/main.
Result: exit 0. Cited was created as a new worktree from freshly fetched origin/main. The plugin branch was created from origin/main and the landing branch from its current master. All three source worktrees were clean before task edits. The explicit README docs branches are required by the approved assignment.

Executed git status --short --branch, git rev-parse HEAD and Get-ChildItem openspec/changes. Result: branch/base confirmed; no predecessor active changes in these worktrees (archive directory only before brand-logos creation).

Executed npx -y -p node@24.21.0 node -p process.execPath, then the returned executable with -p process.version: v24.21.0. The default shell Node was v24.11.0; it was not used for authoritative validation. Initial npm ci invoked npm.ps1's adjacent default Node and emitted engine warnings. Repeated npm ci --no-audit --no-fund through the pinned Node and npm-cli.js completed exit 0 with 693 packages and no lockfile diff. A concurrent baseline startup encountered the in-progress dependency replacement; its subsequent rerun passed. No implementation failure is attributed to that startup.

No merge, production deployment or desktop/profile operation was performed.
