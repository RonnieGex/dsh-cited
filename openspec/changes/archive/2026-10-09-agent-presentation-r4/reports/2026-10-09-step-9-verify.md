# Verify

`openspec validate --all --strict` -> 4 items passed, zero failed. `git diff --check` -> exit 0. Reconciled Fable R4 with implementation: in-tool source highlighting and citation chip, no separate Passage 1 panel, concise provenance, exact 2/3 and English refusal disclosure, unchanged raw canonical records, complete Markdown sentences and correctly scoped verification claims.

Steps 1 through 8 record actual red/green tests, browser checks, curl, sample database equality and documentation. Independent adversarial review is the next closure gate. No author reviews their own implementation. Existing PR baseline CI passed before this change; new commit CI will be verified after push. Landing has no remote, so remote CI is not claimed.

## Issues

- RISK: main-branch evidence is 404 until Fable merges plugin PR #1 before Cited PR #18 and landing publication.
- NOT DONE: Fable's independent art/UX score and acceptance; no 9.5 score is fabricated.
- UNKNOWN: remote CI for the local-only landing.
