# Verify

Requirement author: Fable, approved R8 brief. Implementer: Codex. This is implementation verification, not an independent adversarial review.

| Requirement | Executed evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Approved visual corrections | step-6-browser.md and renderer/shoot data |
| Tests first | step-1-tdd.md records the observed pre-edit failure |
| Build and automated tests | step-4-validation.md |
| Read-only database before/after | step-4-database-method.md and adjacent JSON snapshots |
| HTTP checks | step-5-http.md, all exit 0 / HTTP 200 |
| Documentation/manual | docs/brand-logos.md, README.md; landing also docs/agent-place.md |
| Secret scan | step-8-secrets.md |

Executed `openspec validate brand-logo-layout --strict` -> exit 0 in this repository. Executed `git diff --check` -> exit 0. No dependencies, lockfiles, runtime product code, raw evidence, desktop application or desktop profile changed.

## Closure state

Independent adversarial review is pending. No independent PASS is claimed. Do not archive or commit until that review is obtained. No merge or deployment occurred.

Final strict validation: `openspec validate --all --strict` -> exit 0, 7 items passed, zero failed. Staged whitespace and secret scans pass.
